# Baba Mod Manager

A Mod manager for Baba is You. Currently a work in progress.

## Usage - Developers

The mod manager is intended to be backwards-compatible with any mod, even those that are just singletons and the like. However, you can add some extra flair to your mod for the cost of a little bit of tweaking.

Set up your mod like so in the file system:

```txt
.../Lua
    |- YourMod
    |  |- [mod files]
    |  |- Config.json // more on this later!
    |- YourMod_init.lua
```

`YourMod_init.lua` should call into the mod files inside the `YourMod` directory. You can then add data to `Config.json` to spruce up the mod in the manager. You can use this as a template:

```json
{
    "modid": "dummytest", // String
    "authors": ["Author A", "Author B"], // [String]
    "description": "A very cool description for this mod", // String
    "icon_url": "[Replace this with a url to an icon, either locally or on the net]", // String (optional)
    "banner_url": "[See above, but for a banner]", // String (optional)
    "global": false, // Whether the mod is to be installed globally or in a levelpack (boolean)
    "tags": ["Technical", "Work In Progress"], // [String], any past 4 are ignored
    "links": ["[You can put links here to forward people to the right places]", "[You can have multiple!]"], // [String], can be length 0 if N/A
    "files": ["[This is a list of files that are considered part of the mod, and are moved with it when requested]"], // [String], list relative paths to files here
    "init": "[The file used outside of the folder, if needed.]", // String,
    "sprites": ["[This is a set of sprites the mod uses]"] // [String]
}
```
