# Documentation for the data folder

The data folder contains a couple of files the program uses as either templates or data to retreive.
Listed below is an explanation of all of them.

## !doc.md

This file, which contains the documentation for all the files in the data folder.

## babafuncs.txt

Contains a list of all 338 overridable Baba is You functions. These are used often, since the primary way to modify Baba is You is to override functions from the basegame.

## init.lua

This file is similarly used when merging two mods, calling into a function in the directory for easy use.
